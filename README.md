Database - supabase - postgresSQL DB - Prisma ORM - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
                ORM stands for object-relational mapping, a programming technique that connects object-oriented programming languages with relational databases. ORMs allow developers to work with data using the programming language's objects, instead of writing SQL queries. 
                How ORMs work
                Create a layer
                ORMs use metadata descriptors to create a layer between the programming language and the database. 
                Translate data
                ORMs translate data between the database and the programming language. 
                Generate SQL code
                ORMs generate SQL code to insert, update, create, and delete data in the database. 
                Manage data
                ORMs manage the application's data needs, so developers don't need to write low-level code. 
                Benefits of ORMs
                Increased productivity: ORMs remove the need for boilerplate code and awkward techniques, which can increase developer productivity. 
                Standardized interfaces: ORMs standardize interfaces, which can speed up development time. 
                Consistent view of objects: ORMs allow programmers to maintain a consistent view of objects over time.
